It's similar to training a pet where you reward good behavior and discourage bad behavior. Over time, the computer learns to make better decisions to maximize its rewards. This is used in things like teaching robots to perform tasks and making smart recommendations on websites.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
